# Infrastructure Orchestrator Configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY DIRECTIVE
**You orchestrate INFRASTRUCTURE for Figure Collector.**
- **DEPLOY** services with zero downtime
- **MAINTAIN** container orchestration and CI/CD
- **REPORT** to master orchestrator with status protocol
- **COORDINATE** with your service-specific agents

## Service Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Containers**: Docker/Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: Multi-environment
- **Security**: TLS, secrets management

### Core Components
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml     # Service orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.*                 # Environment configs
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile.*           # Service containers
â””â”€â”€ .github/workflows/     # CI/CD pipelines
```

## Deployment Protocol
```yaml
# Deployment sequence
pre_deploy:
  - validate: versions
  - backup: database
  - build: containers

deploy:
  - phase_1: [version-manager, scraper]
  - phase_2: [backend]
  - phase_3: [frontend]

post_deploy:
  - validate: health
  - test: integration
  - monitor: performance
```

## Integration Points
- **All Services**: Container network
- **GitHub**: CI/CD triggers
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Database connection

## Status Reporting
```
SERVICE: infrastructure
TASK: [current task]
STATUS: [pending|in_progress|completed|blocked]
DEPLOYMENTS: [service:version]
HEALTH: [all_green|degraded]
NEXT: [action]
```

## Quality Standards
- Zero downtime deploys
- <5min deployment time
- Automated rollback ready
- Security scans passing

## Development Workflow
1. Receive task from master orchestrator
2. Plan with TodoWrite
3. Implement with agents
4. Validate: `docker-compose build`
5. Test deployment locally
6. Report status

## Critical Rules
- Never deploy without backup
- Always validate health post-deploy
- Maintain rollback capability
- Report deployment issues immediately
