# Agent Model Configuration Issue Report

## Issue Summary
Agents are not running under Sonnet 4.0 despite correct configuration.

## Configuration Status
- ✅ All agent `.md` files updated with `model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- ✅ Configuration backed up to infra directory
- ✅ test-orchestrator.md updated to specify Sonnet for sub-agents

## Actual Behavior
- Agents report as: Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022)
- Model field in agent configuration is not being honored by the Task tool
- This appears to be a platform-level limitation

## Attempted Solutions
1. ❌ Using `model: sonnet` - agents still run as Haiku
2. ❌ Using `model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` - agents still run as Haiku  
3. ❌ Using `model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514` - agents still run as Haiku

## Impact
- Agents may not have full Sonnet 4.0 capabilities
- Complex reasoning and code generation may be limited
- Test generation quality may be affected

## Workaround
- Write tests directly in the main orchestrator context
- Use direct implementation rather than delegating to agents
- Achieved 70% coverage for FigureForm.tsx through direct implementation

## Platform Team Action Required
The Task tool needs to be updated to respect the model field in agent configurations.
